#MarkS6i
Welcome to my GitHub page! Its not much but I periocically put stuff up that I am working on or found to be useful grenerally.  Check out my public repos if you're interested in Python or C++.  I am a software engineer by vocation; a statistician by education; and a data analyst by avocation.  I teach data analytics to adult learners in a bootcamp format.  You might find repos in any of those areas.
