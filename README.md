# Coach Mark - MarkS6i
Welcome to my GitHub page! Its not much but I periocically put stuff up that I am working on or found to be useful grenerally.  Check out my public repos if you're interested in Python or C++.  I am a software engineer by vocation; a statistician by education; and a data analyst by avocation.  I teach data analytics to adult learners in a bootcamp format.  You might find repos in any of those areas.

### For those interested in C++:
Take a look at my **bucket** repo for a useful template for storing data in buckets defined as sub ranges on an ordered sequence.

### For those interested in Python:
If you use BeautifulSoup a lot, take a look at my short BeautifulScoop repo. I created a clas whic can visualize the results of a BeautifulSoup search -- its great for debugging your BeautifulSoup code.

I was tired of printing images on my printer and using up ink because the image had either a black background or a not-quite-white background. If you have the same problem, the image-convert repo has a solution which will save you ink.

### For those interested in Data Analytics:
I have an EDA Jupyter notebook reop, analyze-pps-public, where I explore some data which looked like it might be two overlapping gaussian (noremal) distributions.  It's somewhat more complicated because the data is collected around the clock and therefore there are overlapping tails.  I fit the data to von Mises distributions to handle the circular nature of the data.  I also experiment wth polar plots to see if the plot is more understandable to outside parties.
